Create a new user in MySQL. Permissions to acces and manage tables and data.
JOIN tables for querys and type of JOIN.

How to Create a New User
In Part 1 of the MySQL Tutorial, we did all of the editing in MySQL as the root user, with full access to all of the databases. However, in cases where more restrictions may be required, there are ways to create users with custom permissions.
Introduction to the MySQL GRANT statement
The CREATE USER statement creates one or more user accounts with no privileges. It means that the user accounts can log in to the MySQL Server, but cannot do anything such as selecting a database and querying data from tables.

To allow user accounts to work with database objects, you need to grant the user accounts privileges. And the GRANT statement grants a user account one or more privileges.
SQL technique: subqueries
Sometimes you don‚Äôt have enough information available when you design a query to determine which rows you want. In this case, you‚Äôll have to find the required information with a subquery.
Basic query operation: the join
SQL syntax
In most queries, we will want to see data from two or more tables. To do this, we need to join the tables in a way that matches up the right information from each one to the other‚Äîin our example, listing all of the customer data along with all of the order data for the orders that each customer has placed. In the latest SQL standard, the join is specified in the FROM clause.
SQL technique: multiple joins and the distinct keyword
It is important to realize that if you have a properly designed and linked database, you can retrieve information from as many tables as you want, specify retrieval conditions based on any data in the tables, and show the results in any order that you like.
7 types of JOINs and how to use them
Here is the list of 7 types of JOINs that you are going the use quite a lot in SQL.

INNER JOIN
FULL [OUTER] JOIN
FULL [OUTER] JOIN without the intersection
LEFT [OUTER] JOIN
