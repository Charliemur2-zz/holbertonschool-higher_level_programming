# 0x0D. SQL - Introduction

What is Data?
In simple words, data can be facts related to any object in consideration. For example, your name, age, height, weight, etc. are some data related to you. A picture, image, file, pdf, etc. can also be considered data.
What is a Database?
A database is a systematic collection of data. They support electronic storage and manipulation of data. Databases make data management easy.

Let us discuss a few examples: An online telephone directory uses a database to store data of people, phone numbers, other contact details. Your electricity service provider uses a database to manage billing, client-related issues, handle fault data, etc.

Let us also consider Facebook. It needs to store, manipulate, and present data related to members, their friends, member activities, messages, advertisements, and a lot more. We can provide a countless number of examples for the usage of databases.
What is SQL?
SQL is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases. SQL can be used to insert, search, update, and delete database records. SQL can do lots of other operations, including optimizing and maintenance of databases. SQL stands for Structured Query language, pronounced as "S-Q-L" or sometimes as "See-Quel"... Relational databases like MySQL Database, Oracle, MS SQL Server, Sybase, etc. use ANSI SQL.
